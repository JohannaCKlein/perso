Second year PhD student, I am working under the supervision of Julien Pilmé at the Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry (LCT @UMR7616) at Sorbonne University. My work consists in a development of a software package whose role is the prediction of chemical reactions. This new approach combines IQA energy decomposition scheme on topological domains and conceptual DFT.
